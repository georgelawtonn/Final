# Reinforcement-Learning-Self-Driving-Car-
Using deep reinforcement learning and OpenAI-gym to develop a self-driving car simulation, training it to find optimal 
paths on sample courses. With autonomous vehicles becoming more common, understanding basics of how they work is 
valuable. Project provides experience applying deep RL to complex real-world problems like driving using PPO.

Demo of the car agent learning self-driving:
